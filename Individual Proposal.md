### Analysis 1: **Basic Demographic Summary**

- **Variables to Explore**: `Age`, `Income`, `Gender`, `Education Level`
- **What This Analysis Will Do**:
   - This analysis will summarize the main demographic variables, providing averages and distributions for `Age`, `Income`, and counts for `Gender` and `Education Level`.
   - I will create visualizations like histograms and bar charts to display the spread and central tendencies of these variables.
- **Expected Outcome**:
   - This analysis will reveal the general demographic structure of the dataset, showing, for instance, the age range and average income, and how education and gender are distributed.

### Analysis 2: **Correlation Analysis between Income and Education**

- **Variables to Explore**: `Income`, `Education Level`
- **What This Analysis Will Do**:
   - I will examine the correlation between `Income` and `Education Level` to see if there is a positive relationship between higher education and income levels.
   - Using numerical encoding for education, a correlation coefficient will quantify the relationship, and a scatter plot will illustrate the trend.
- **Expected Outcome**:
   - I expect a positive correlation, suggesting that individuals with higher education levels may have higher incomes.
   - This finding could suggest a socio-economic link between education and financial well-being within the dataset.

### Analysis 3: **Behavior Analysis by Age Group**

- **Variables to Explore**: `Age`, `Engagement Score` (or similar behavioral variable if available)
- **What This Analysis Will Do**:
   - This analysis will compare behavior across different age groups, focusing on a behavioral metric like `Engagement Score`. I will split `Age` into categories (e.g., 18–30, 31–45, 46+) and calculate average engagement within each group.
   - Bar charts will help visualize differences in behavior across age groups.
- **Expected Outcome**:
   - This analysis might show that younger participants have higher engagement scores, while older groups might show lower scores.
   - Such patterns could suggest that age influences behavior, with potential implications for targeted engagement strategies.
