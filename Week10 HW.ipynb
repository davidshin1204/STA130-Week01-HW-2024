    "\n",
    "   A **continuous variable** is numeric and can take on an infinite number of values (e.g., height or age). For a model with a continuous predictor \\( x \\), the form is:\n",
    "   \\[\n",
    "   y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x\n",

    "   An **indicator variable** (or dummy variable) takes on values of 0 or 1, indicating the presence or absence of a categorical attribute (e.g., gender coded as 0 for male and 1 for female). The linear form with an indicator variable \\( I(x) \\) is:\n",
    "   \\[\n",
    "   y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 I(x)\n",

    "\n",
    "   Adding an **interaction term** between a continuous variable \\( x \\) and an indicator variable \\( I(z) \\) in Multiple Linear Regression allows the effect of the continuous predictor to vary by category. The model form becomes:\n",

    "   When representing a non-binary categorical variable with \\( k \\) categories, we use \\( k-1 \\) indicator variables to encode it. For a categorical variable \\( z \\) with three levels (e.g., \"low,\" \"medium,\" \"high\"), the model might look like:\n",

The coefficients \\( \\beta_1 \\) and \\( \\beta_2 \\) measure the difference in \\( y \\) between each group and the baseline.

    "### How to Use the Formulas to Make Predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the two models (one with interaction and one without), the key difference lies in how we interpret the relationship between the predictor variables (TV and Online advertising) and the outcome (Sales). Here's how you use the two formulas to make predictions:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Model Without Interaction (Additive Model)**\n",
    "The linear form of the **additive model** is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\text{TV} + \\beta_2 \\text{Online}\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "To make predictions using this formula:\n",
    "- **\\( \\beta_0 \\)** is the intercept, representing the baseline outcome (Sales) when both TV and Online advertising budgets are zero.\n",
    "- **\\( \\beta_1 \\)** is the effect of the TV advertising budget on sales, assuming that the Online advertising budget is constant.\n",
    "- **\\( \\beta_2 \\)** is the effect of the Online advertising budget on sales, assuming that the TV advertising budget is constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, to predict sales with this model, you simply plug in the values for TV and Online advertising. The prediction is the sum of the individual effects of each advertising medium.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "If the TV advertising budget is $1000 and the Online advertising budget is $2000, then the predicted sales would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\times 1000 + \\beta_2 \\times 2000\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, each component contributes independently to the final prediction. The TV and Online effects do not depend on each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Model With Interaction (Synergistic Model)**\n",
    "The linear form of the **interaction model** is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\text{TV} + \\beta_2 \\text{Online} + \\beta_3 (\\text{TV} \\times \\text{Online})\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "In this model, the interaction term \\( \\text{TV} \\times \\text{Online} \\) allows us to capture the **combined effect** of the two advertising budgets. To predict sales, you still use the individual contributions of TV and Online, but now the **interaction** between them also comes into play, modifying the predicted outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **\\( \\beta_3 \\)** captures the change in sales that happens when both TV and Online budgets are high, over and above the sum of their individual effects. If \\( \\beta_3 \\) is positive, the two types of advertising work together to increase sales more than their individual effects would suggest. If \\( \\beta_3 \\) is negative, the combined effect of both types of ads is less than their sum.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make predictions using this model:\n",
    "- You first calculate the contribution of TV and Online individually, just like in the additive model.\n",
    "- Then, you calculate the interaction term \\( \\text{TV} \\times \\text{Online} \\) and add that to the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "If the TV advertising budget is $1000 and the Online advertising budget is $2000, and the interaction term is significant, the prediction would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\times 1000 + \\beta_2 \\times 2000 + \\beta_3 \\times (1000 \\times 2000)\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "The interaction term \\( \\text{TV} \\times \\text{Online} \\) adjusts the prediction based on how the two advertising mediums interact with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "### High-Level Explanation of the Difference in Predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Without interaction (additive model)**: The effects of TV and Online advertising are independent of each other. The impact of increasing the TV budget on sales is always the same, regardless of how much is spent on Online ads. Similarly, increasing the Online budget impacts sales independently of the TV budget. This model assumes that both advertising channels have **separate and constant effects** on sales.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **With interaction (synergistic model)**: The impact of TV and Online advertising on sales depends on the level of the other. If both are high, their combined effect on sales may be greater (or less) than the sum of their individual effects. This model assumes that TV and Online ads have a **joint effect** on sales that is not simply additive, but synergistic or potentially diminishing. The interaction term \\( \\beta_3 \\) captures this relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general terms, the model with the interaction allows for a more **flexible** prediction, accounting for the possibility that the two variables (TV and Online budgets) do not just add together, but may amplify or reduce each other's effects depending on their values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transition to Binary (Categorical) Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, if we assume that the advertising budgets are categorized into two levels (high or low), rather than being continuous, the predictor variables become **binary** indicator variables. We would use indicator variables for each of the two predictors:\n",
    "\n",
    "- \\( \\text{TV}_{\\text{High}} \\): Indicator variable for whether the TV budget is high (1 if high, 0 if low).\n",
    "- \\( \\text{Online}_{\\text{High}} \\): Indicator variable for whether the Online budget is high (1 if high, 0 if low).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Model Without Interaction (Additive Model with Binary Variables)**\n",
    "\n",
    "The linear form of the additive model using binary indicators is:\n",

    "\n",
    "2. **Logistic Regression Models**:\n",
    "   - We fit two logistic regression models using `smf.logit`:\n",
    "     - **Additive Model**: This model includes predictors without interaction terms.\n",
    "     - **Interaction Model**: This model includes interaction terms between `Attack` and `Legendary`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Model Summaries**:\n",
    "   - We print out the summary of both models using `log_reg_additive.summary()` and `log_reg_interaction.summary()`. This provides statistical details like coefficients, standard errors, and p-values.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Visualization**:\n",
    "   - We use `plotly.express` to create scatter plots with best fit lines showing the relationship between `Attack` and the binary outcome (`str8fyre`) for both models.\n",
    "   - The first plot shows the additive model, while the second plot shows the interaction model. If the interaction term is significant, you'll see that the slopes of the best fit lines for different values of `Legendary` will differ.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Model Summaries**: The printed summary tables show the coefficients for each predictor in both models, helping you interpret how each variable affects the log-odds of the outcome.\n",
    "- **Visualizations**: The scatter plots display how `Attack` affects the binary outcome in both models. The interaction plot will highlight whether the effect of `Attack` differs by the value of `Legendary`.\n",

The **model fit** for  `model4` resulted in an **overfit model** because the specification of its **linear form** was overly complex (relative to the the amount of available data). Indeed, `model4` is rediculously complex as can be seen from `model4_fit.summary()`. This in turn allowed the **model fit** to \"detect\" idiosyncratic associations spuriously present specifically in the **training** dataset but which did not **generalize** to the **testing** dataset. If a model is too **complex** then it will find and model \"patterns\" in a **training** dataset which are actually just accidental \"noise\" from the random sampling nature of the dataset. The simpler (or more parsimoneous) `model3` on the other hand was able to identify **predictive associations** in the **training** dataset which did **generalize** to the **testing** dataset. This is because `model3` only sought to understand simpler **predictive association** for which there was enough data in the **training** dataset to reliably detect and obviously identify. And these patterns were indeed sufficiently \"real\" in the sense that they were present and **generalized** into the **testing** dataset as well as the **training** dataset. So they could be \"found\" in the **training** and then used in (**generalized** to) the **testing** dataset._\n",
    "> \n",
    "> _This question therefore addresses the topic of the **evidence** a given dataset provides for the **predictive associations** detected by a **fitted model**. It should be increasingly clear at this point that evidence for a model can be addressed using **coefficent hypothesis testing** in the context of **multiple linear regression**, but that examinations of \"in sample\" versus \"out of sample\" **model performance** metrics are what in fact are directly designed to address this question of **generalizability**. That said, this question introduces another consideration of **multicollinearity** as something that affects the **generalizability** of **model fits** in the **multiple linear regression** context. A good question that a ChatBot could help you understand is (a) \"why is **generalizability** more uncertain if two **predictor variables** are highly **correlated**?\" and (b) \"why is **generalizability** more uncertain if multiple **predictor variables** are highly **multicollinear**?\"_\n",
    ">\n",
    "> _The four code cells below are not necessary for answering this question; however, they introduce two very practical helpful tools for the **multiple linear regression** context that are immediately relevant for this question. The first is the so-called **condition number** (of a \"design matrix\") which provides a very simple diagnostic which can serve as a measure the degree of **multicollinearity** that is present in a **model fit**. If this number is \"very large\" then there is a large degree of **multicollinearity** and suggests room for doubt regarding the **generalizability** of the **fitted model**. The second tool(s) are the `center` and `scale` functions. It is best practice to \"center and scale\" **continuous predictor variables** (but not **indicator variables**) in the **multiple linear regression** context as is done below. While \"centering and scaling\" does make interpreting the predictions on the original scale of the data slighly more complicated, it also must be done in order to get a \"true\" evaluation of the degree of **multicollinearity** present in a **model fit** using the **condition number** of the model (\"design matrix\"). The examples below show that the **condition number** reported by a **fitted model** are \"artificially inflacted\" if \"centering and scaling\" is not used. Specically, they show that the **condition number** of `model3_fit` is really `1.66` (as opposed to the \"very large\" `343` which is reported without \"centering and scaling\"); whereas, the **condition number** for `model4_fit` is \"very (VERY) large\" irrespective of \"centering and scaling\", showing that the overwheling presense of **multicollinearity** in `model4_fit` is in fact a very real thing.  Indeed, we have already seen that `model4_fit` is grossly **overfit** and does not remotely **generalize** beyond its **training** dataset. Without knowing this, however, the comically large **condition number** for `model4_fit` (after \"centering and scaling\") makes it abundantly clear that we should have great doubts about the likely **generalizability** of `model4_fit` (even without examining specific aspects of **multicollinearity** directly or examining \"in sample\" versus \"out of sample\" **model performance** comparisions)._\n",
    ">\n",
    "> - _The \"specific aspects of **multicollinearity**\" reference above refer to understanding and attributing the detrmimental affects of specific **predictor variables** towards **multicollinearity**. This can be done using so-called **variance inflation factors**, but this is beyond the scope of STA130. We should be aware that the presence of excessive **multicollinearity** as indicated by a large **condition number** for a (\"centered and scaled\") **fitted model** raises grave concerns regarding the potential **generalizability** of the model._\n",
    ">\n",
    "> _The `np.corrcoef(model4_spec.exog)` examination of the **correlations** of a \"design matrix\" considered in ths problems prompt is analogous to the examination of the **correlations** present in a dataset that might considered when initially examining the **predictor variables** of a dataset, such as `pokeaman.iloc[:,4:12].corr()`. Indeed, such an examination is often the first step in examining the potential presence of **multicollinearity** among the **predictor variables** of a dataset. However, these are consideration of **pairwise correlation**, whereas **multicollinearity** generalizes this notion to the full collection of **predictor variables** together. A **condition number** for a \"centered and scale\" version of a **fit model** can therefore be viewed as serving the analogous purposes of a multivariate generalization of **pairwise correlation**._\n",

    "#### **From model3_fit and model4_fit to model5_linear_form:**\n",
    "- **Model 3 (`model3_linear_form`)** was a simple linear model with just two predictors: `Attack` and `Defense`. This model’s results were likely insufficient, as it might have failed to capture the complexity of the relationships between the features.\n",
    "- **Model 4 (`model4_linear_form`)** introduced **interaction terms** to capture more complex relationships between predictors (e.g., `Attack * Defense * Speed`). However, the inclusion of too many interaction terms led to multicollinearity, making the model unstable.\n",
    "- **Model 5 (`model5_linear_form`)** extends model 4 by simplifying the feature set:\n",
    "  - **Main Effects**: Instead of using excessive interactions, it focuses on **main effects** like `Attack`, `Defense`, `Speed`, and other categorical variables like `Legendary`, `Generation`, and `Type 1` and `Type 2`.\n",
    "  - This extension aims for a more **parsimonious** model (fewer predictors and interactions), reducing multicollinearity and improving interpretability while still including a variety of important features.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **From model5_linear_form to model6_linear_form:**\n",
    "- **Model 6 (`model6_linear_form`)** builds on model 5 by:\n",
    "  - **Adding significant binary indicators** that show the relevance of specific levels of categorical variables (`Type 1` and `Generation`). For instance, including `I(Q(\"Type 1\")==\"Normal\")` and `I(Generation==2)` adds important binary variables that capture the effects of specific categories in the data.\n",
    "  - This model is more focused on **significant categorical variables** identified in earlier models and aims to improve prediction by refining the features used.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **From model6_linear_form to model7_linear_form:**\n",
    "- **Model 7 (`model7_linear_form`)** extends model 6 by:\n",
    "  - **Introducing interactions** between key variables like `Attack`, `Speed`, `Sp. Def`, and `Sp. Atk`. This aims to capture more complex relationships between predictors, based on insights gained from the previous models.\n",
    "  - While the interaction terms are added, they are more **focused** (only between the most important continuous predictors), which should allow the model to capture non-linear effects while avoiding the issue of overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **From model7_linear_form to model7_linear_form_CS (Centered and Scaled Model):**\n",
    "- **Model 7 with Centering and Scaling** (CS) further refines the model by **centering and scaling** the continuous predictors (like `Attack`, `Speed`, `Sp. Def`), making the model more stable and reducing issues of multicollinearity. This step also helps in improving model convergence.\n",
    "- **Condition Number Improvement**: The **condition number** (`Cond. No.`) becomes significantly smaller (15.4), indicating that centering and scaling helped to mitigate the issues with multicollinearity and numerical instability that were present in the previous models.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Summary of the Rationale:**\n",

    "- **Model 5** simplifies the feature set to reduce overfitting and multicollinearity while still capturing important features. It builds on the lessons from **model 3** (focus on main effects) and **model 4** (inclusion of categorical variables).\n",
    "- **Model 6** further refines the approach by adding **binary indicator variables** for relevant categories, improving predictions by focusing on important levels of categorical variables.\n",
    "- **Model 7** incorporates **interaction terms** to capture more complex relationships between continuous predictors, but still maintains a balance to avoid excessive complexity.\n",

    "   - The **out-of-sample R-squared** is computed by predicting the values on the test set (`pokeaman_test`) and comparing these predictions with the actual target values (`HP`).\n",
    "   \n",
    "4. **Visualization**:\n",
    "   - The results for both \"in-sample\" and \"out-of-sample\" R-squared values are stored in a DataFrame and visualized using Plotly's scatter plot. The line `y = x` is added to help visualize how well the two performance metrics correlate.\n",
    "   \n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Interpretation of Results:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ideal Case**:\n",
    "   - If the model performs equally well on both the training and testing data, we would expect the points to fall along the **line y = x** in the scatter plot. This would suggest that the model is generalizing well to unseen data, without overfitting or underfitting.\n",
    "   \n",
    "- **Overfitting**:\n",
    "   - If the **in-sample R-squared** is much higher than the **out-of-sample R-squared**, this suggests **overfitting**. The model performs well on the training data but struggles to generalize to the test data. Overfitting typically happens when the model is too complex (e.g., too many predictors or interactions).\n",
    "   \n",
    "- **Underfitting**:\n",
    "   - If both the **in-sample R-squared** and **out-of-sample R-squared** are low, the model might be **underfitting** the data. This means the model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the data, and it fails to perform well on both the training and test sets.\n",
    "   \n",
    "- **Model Instability**:\n",
    "   - If the points in the scatter plot are scattered and do not follow any discernible pattern (i.e., not near the line `y = x`), this could indicate **model instability**. The model might be very sensitive to the choice of train-test split, causing large variations in performance. This could be a sign that the model is not robust enough and needs refinement.\n",
    "   \n",
    "- **Fluctuations Between Splits**:\n",
    "   - The **random nature** of the train-test split (due to not fixing the random seed) introduces variability in the model’s performance. This will help you see how much the performance of the model depends on the specific split of the data, which could suggest whether the model is overfitting, underfitting, or unstable.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Conclusion and Purpose of the Demonstration**:\n",
    "\n",
    "This simulation and visualization help in understanding the relationship between **in-sample** and **out-of-sample** performance over multiple train-test splits. The variation between these metrics gives insight into how well the model is generalizing, and helps diagnose whether the model is overfitting, underfitting, or unstable. By observing how these metrics fluctuate across multiple runs, you gain a better understanding of the model's reliability and robustness, guiding you toward potential improvements in model design, such as adjusting the complexity, adding regularization, or refining the feature selection process."

    "> _While we had seemed to **validate** the **generalizability** of `model7_fit` in **model building** exercise of the previous \"Question 7\" above, as well as the improved **model performance** of `model7_fit` comapred to `model6_fit`, the `model7_fit` model was always nonetheless more complex than `model6_fit` model (as seen by comparing their `.summary()` methods). This complexity, despite the minimal concerns regarding **multicollinearity**, should always have suggested some room for caution. This is because, as previously discussed in \"Question 6\" above, a complex **linear form** specification can allow a \"**model fit** to 'detect' idiosyncratic associations spuriously present specifically in the **training** dataset but which did not **generalize** to the **testing** dataset.\" Indeed, a close look at the **p-values** in `model7_fit.summary()` will show that the **evidence** (in the data) for many of the **estimated coefficients** of `model7_fit` is in fact not very strong. In comparision, the **evidence** (in the data) for many of the **estimated coefficients** of `model6_fit.summary()` is consistently stronger._\n",
    ">\n",
    "> _As discussed towards the end of the commentary in the previous \"Question 7\" above, the primary purpose of **multiple linear regression** methodology is to allow us to assess the **evidence** (in the data) for a given **linear form** specification based on **coefficient hypothesis testing**. In this regard, then, `model6_fit` might be preferred over `model7_fit` despite the better \"out of sample\" **model performance** of `model7_fit` over `model6_fit`. This may not be enough to convince everyone however, so an additional consideration that might be made here is that the more simpler (more parsimoneous) nature of `model6_fit` should be preferred over `model7_fit` from the perspective of **model interpretability**. Indeed, it is quite unclear how exactly one should think about and understand a four-way **interaction** variable such as `Attack:Speed:Q(\"Sp. Def\"):Q(\"Sp. Atk\")` in conjunction with the whole host of the additional lower order interations. From a **model interpretability** perspective, understanding the meaning of the complex specification of `model7_fit` is \"challenging\" and \"complicated\" to say the least._\n",
    ">\n",
    "> - _There are also often circumstances where **model interpretability** can be MORE IMPORTANT than raw **model performance** in \"out of sample\" **prediction**._\n",
    "> - _This is ESPECIALLY true if **predictive model performance** is relatively comparable between models of two different complexity levels. In such cases, the benefits of better **model interpretability** might provide a clear argument for the simpler (more parsimoneous) model, not to mention the additional potential benefit of more consistent improved **generalizability** over the the more complex model this might offer._\n",
    ">\n",
    "> _This question drives home the point that a simpler (more parsimoneous) model always offers the potential benefit of more consistent **generalizability**, not to mention **interpretability**, over more complex models. We should *ONLY* use increasingly complex models that without questions outperfrm simler models. The code below illustrates this by further additionally raising the consideration that the random **train-test** approach used above is actually not the most natural one available for our dataset, which has different \"Generations\". In fact, if we were actually using this model to make **predictions**, we would increasingly acquire more data over time which we would use to make **precictions** about future data which we haven't yet seen, which is what the code demonstrates. And low and behold, this exposes **generalizability** concerns that we missed when we used the dataset in an idealized way and not actually how we would use such a dataset in practice in the real world (where data would arrive sequentially, and current data is used to predict future data). These **generalizability** concerns do affect both models, but the appear to be more problematic for `model7_fit` than `model6_fit`, which is certainly a result of the increased complexity of `model7_fit` which always opens up the possibility of model **overfitting**._\n",

    "### **Context:**\n",
    "1. **Original Model Performance:**\n",
    "   - The models are being evaluated on the Pokémon data for different generations (`Generation 1`, `Generation 1 to 5`, etc.).\n",
    "   - The **in-sample** R-squared represents how well the model fits the data it was trained on.\n",
    "   - The **out-of-sample** R-squared measures how well the model can predict data it has not seen before (i.e., how well it generalizes to new, unseen data).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Steps:**\n",
    "#### 1. **Model on Generation 1 Data (predicting future generations):**\n",
    "   - `model7_gen1_predict_future` is trained on Pokémon data from **Generation 1** (`pokeaman[pokeaman.Generation == 1]`).\n",
    "   - The **in-sample R-squared** is calculated for this model to check how well it fits the Generation 1 data.\n",
    "   - The model is then tested on Pokémon data from **other generations** (data where `Generation != 1`) and the **out-of-sample R-squared** is computed, showing how well the Generation 1 model can generalize to future generations.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   The same is done for `model6` using the formula defined for it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Model on Generations 1 to 5 Data (predicting Generation 6):**\n",
    "   - `model7_gen1to5_predict_future` is trained on data from **Generations 1 through 5** (`pokeaman[pokeaman.Generation != 6]`).\n",
    "   - The **in-sample R-squared** for this model is computed to check how well it fits the data from Generations 1 to 5.\n",
    "   - Then, the model is tested on data from **Generation 6** (`pokeaman[pokeaman.Generation == 6]`) to compute the **out-of-sample R-squared**, which tells us how well the model generalizes to a completely new generation of Pokémon data.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Similarly, the same procedure is done for `model6`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Interpretation of the Results:**\n",
    "The results output the following information for each model:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **In-Sample R-squared (original)**: This is the R-squared value for the model's fit on the data it was trained on. It tells us how well the model fits the training data.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Out-of-Sample R-squared (original)**: This R-squared value reflects the model’s ability to predict data it has not seen before. A low out-of-sample R-squared suggests that the model is overfitting (it works well on the training data but poorly on new data).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **In-Sample R-squared (predicting future generations)**: This value represents how well the model trained on specific generations (e.g., Generation 1 data) fits that generation's data. The model might perform well here, but we’re interested in how it performs on new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Out-of-Sample R-squared (predicting future generations)**: This value is critical because it reflects how well a model trained on earlier generations (like Generation 1 or Generations 1-5) can predict new data from later generations (e.g., Generation 6). A good model should generalize well to unseen data from different time periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What the Code Illustrates:**\n",
    "- **Overfitting vs. Generalization**: If the in-sample R-squared is very high but the out-of-sample R-squared is much lower, it suggests overfitting. The model might be too closely tailored to the training data and not perform well on new, unseen data. Ideally, we want both in-sample and out-of-sample R-squared values to be close, indicating a model that generalizes well.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Generation-Specific Predictions**: By training models on data from one generation (e.g., Generation 1) and testing them on data from later generations (e.g., Generation 6), the code examines how well earlier-generation models can predict future-generation Pokémon stats. This simulates a scenario where we have data from past Pokémon generations but need to predict characteristics for newer generations.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Model Validation**: The process of training on one subset and testing on another (out-of-sample validation) helps evaluate the model's true predictive power. A high in-sample R-squared combined with a low out-of-sample R-squared indicates that the model might not be as robust as it seems, highlighting the importance of cross-validation for model performance assessment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Conclusion:**\n",
    "The goal of this exercise is to evaluate and compare how well models trained on specific generations (or subsets of data) can generalize to other, unseen generations. This process demonstrates the importance of balancing model fit (in-sample performance) with generalization (out-of-sample performance) to avoid overfitting and ensure that models can make accurate predictions on new data."

    "Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Explaining Code and Results**:\n",
    "   - You shared several blocks of Python code, which involved training various linear regression models on a Pokémon dataset to predict the `HP` of Pokémon based on features like `Attack`, `Defense`, `Speed`, `Legendary status`, and various types of interactions.\n",
    "   - The models were tested both in-sample (on the data they were trained on) and out-of-sample (on a test set that the model has not seen during training).\n",
    "   - We discussed the impact of **multicollinearity** (high correlations between predictor variables) and how **model performance** (in terms of R-squared values) varies when models are trained and tested on different subsets of the data (such as different generations of Pokémon).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Key Concepts**:\n",
    "   - **Multicollinearity**: The presence of high correlations between predictor variables can negatively affect model performance, especially for making general predictions on out-of-sample data.\n",
    "   - **Overfitting and Underfitting**: The idea is to avoid overfitting (model performs well on training data but poorly on test data) and underfitting (model performs poorly on both training and test data). We also discussed situations where sometimes the **out-of-sample R-squared** may be better than the in-sample R-squared, which could indicate model underfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Model Training and Testing**:\n",
    "   - Different models (Model 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) were trained and tested on the Pokémon data with a 50-50 train-test split. The models evolved by adding more features (e.g., `Generation`, `Type 1`, `Type 2`), interactions between features, and centering and scaling to improve the model's performance.\n",
    "   - The idea was to evaluate how the models would perform with different specifications and on different subsets of the data (e.g., training on earlier generations and predicting for later generations).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Purpose of Experiment**:\n",
    "   - You aimed to see how well the models could generalize to unseen data, which is crucial in machine learning. We also discussed the importance of **model validation** (using training and testing splits) to avoid overfitting and ensure reliable predictions on new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Extension to Future Generations**:\n",
    "   - The code also demonstrated how models trained on earlier Pokémon generations were used to predict the HP for Pokémon from later generations. This allowed us to assess how well models could generalize to future generations, providing insights into model robustness and generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **For Loop for Performance Metrics**:\n",
    "   - A for-loop approach was introduced to repeatedly train models, split the data randomly, and collect in-sample and out-of-sample R-squared metrics. This loop-based method was designed to demonstrate the consistency (or inconsistency) of model performance when repeated across different train-test splits, potentially highlighting overfitting or underfitting in different cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways:\n",
    "- The analysis explored model performance across different data subsets (e.g., Pokémon generations) to evaluate generalization.\n",
    "- Emphasis was placed on the challenges of overfitting, multicollinearity, and the importance of validating models with out-of-sample data.\n",
    "- The for-loop method was a means of performing repeated validation to understand the variability of model performance.\n",

    "This homework's \"Question 3\" introduced the idea of performing some **multiple linear regression** analyses on dataset from the Canadian Social Connection Survey. While other questions of this homework focussed on other datasets, the general analyses and principles they introduce are no doubt informative and applicable to this the dataset for our course project. Ideally, this should put you in a position to quite proficiently perform **multiple linear regression** analyses for the course project if you so desire and find appropriate for the objectives of you course project submission. Thus, the following (and more) should be possible at this stage... \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Select multiple **predictors predictor** from the Canadian Social Connection Survey data and examine how they jointly influence an outcome variable, paying special attention to the inclusion and interpretation of **categorical** and **indicator variables** and **interactions** (in terms of \"baseline\" reference groups and \"contrast\" or \"offsets\").\n",

    "2. Visualize different kinds of **predictive association** relationships, including **interactions** and relationship between **predictor** and the **outcome** variables that change across different levels of other **categorical** or **indicator predictor variables**, using tools like `plotly.express`.\n",

    "4. Assess the presence of **multicollinearity** by considering the **condition numbers** of **fitted models** (with \"centering and scaling\") and their subsequent potential implications on **generalizability** of **fitted models**; and, perhaps even examine **pairwise correlation** and/or **variance inflation factors** for each **predictor variable** if you're feeling extra ambitious and want to go well \"above and beyond\" (in which case you could also consider the relationship between **multicollinearity** and why one level of a **categorical** variable is always omitted).\n",
